Project Overview
This project aims to improve crowd management in stadiums and optimize parking space usage by deploying AI models for detecting crowd density and parking space availability. 
The Crowd Detection Model helps analyze crowd flow in real-time, while the Parking Detection Model identifies empty and occupied parking spots.


Model 1: Crowd Detection
Description
The Crowd Detection Model detects the presence of people in a given area and calculates crowd density.
This model is crucial for monitoring stadium crowd movements and managing crowd flow for safety and efficiency.
